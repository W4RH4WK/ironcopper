# Core Mechanics

Iron & Copper, like any good pen-and-paper RPG uses dice to determine the outcome of actions.
There are only 3 basic types of rolls that are used for all mechanics of the game:

- **Skill checks** determine whether an action succeeds or fails.
- **Extended skill checks** determine how long an action takes.
  Failure happens in case there is a timelimit, which is exceeded.
- **Damage rolls** determine how much damage an offensive action inflicts.
  Note that not all offensive actions rely on damage rolls.

def d20(adv: int = 0) -> int:
    """
    Rolls a 20-sided die (D20) and returns the result â€” the higher, the better.
    This is commonly used for skill checks and extended skill checks.

    There is a twist though:
    - With **advantage**, multiple dice are rolled, the result is determined by the highest die.
    - **Disadvantage** works the same, but the lowest die determines the result.

    `abs(adv)` determines the number of dice added, a positive or negative value indicates advantage or disadvantage respectively.
    Advantage and disadvantage on the same roll cancel each other out.

    Example:
    ```
    > d20()             # a regular roll
    D20: 5

    > d20(-1)           # roll with disadvantage
    D20-: [19, 3] â†’ 3

    > d20(2)            # roll with double advantage
    D20+: [9, 4, 16] â†’ 16

    Rolls 6-sided dice (D6), commonly used for damage rolls.

    If a damage roll is a **critical damage roll**, the result is increased by `6 * count`.
